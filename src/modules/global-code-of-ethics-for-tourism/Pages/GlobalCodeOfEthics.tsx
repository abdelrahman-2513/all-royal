          Our commitment aligns with the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism
          (GCET), established to guide governments, the travel industry, local
          communities, and travelers in making tourism beneficial and
          environmentally conscious. This set of principles, adopted by the UN
          World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in 1999 and endorsed by the United
          Nations in 2001, supports responsible tourism development that
          respects the environment, cultural heritage, and communities.

          Ethical Practices

          Although the Code is voluntary, it encourages ethical practices in
          tourism globally, with guidance from the World Committee on Tourism
          Ethics (WCTE) to address any concerns related to its implementation.
